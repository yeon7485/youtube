                "description": "Gerçekler mutlu etmez. Ancak mutsuzluğun ve hayatın gerçeklerinin harekete geçirici etkisi vardır. Behçet Yalın Özkara eğitimin mutluluk getireceğine inandı. Bu nedenle ESOGÜ İşletmeden lisans ve doktora, Hacettepe’den Yüksek Lisans, Anadolu İktisattan lisans, Dış ticaret ve Halkla ilişkilerden ise önlisans diplomalarını aldı. Ancak elde ettiği mutluluk çok kısa sürdü. Bu sefer, Yurtdışında eğitim görerek mutluluğu yakalayacağına inandı. Seul Hanyang, Massachusetts ve Michigan üniversitelerinde bulundu. Yine olmadı. Ardından şöhret belki beni mutlu eder diye umdu. Akademiklink isimli bir youtube kanalı açtı. Behçet Yalın Özkara believed that education would lead him to happiness. For this reason, he pursued education and received several degrees; bachelor's degree and Phd. in Business at ESOGU, master at Hacettepe, bachelor's degree in Economics and associate degree in Foreign Trade and Public Relations at Anadolu University. However, the happiness he achieved didn't last long. This time, he thought he would find happiness by studying abroad. Then he's been at Hanyang University of Seoul, University of Massachusettes and University of Michigan. Happiness didn't happen again. Then he thought fame might bring him happiness. So he started a Youtube Channel named \"Akademiklink\". He is still unhappy but has full faith that someday he will be happy. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case.

SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nAs the Athletic Director and head coach of the Varsity Soccer team at Ryerson University, Dr. Joseph is often asked what skills he is searching for as a recruiter: is it speed? Strength? Agility? In Dr. Joseph's TEDx Talk, he explores self confidence and how it is not just the most important skill in athletics, but in our lives.\n \nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

Cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky shares examples of language -- from an Aboriginal community in Australia that uses cardinal directions instead of left and right to the multiple words for blue in Russian -- that suggest the answer is a resounding yes. \"The beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is,\" Boroditsky says. \"Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000.\"\n\nCheck out more TED Talks: http://www.ted.com\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

                "description": "Everyone has the ability to build mental strength, but most people don't know how. \r\nWe spend a lot of time talking about physical strength and physical health, but much less time on mental strength and mental health. \r\nWe can choose to perform exercises that will help us learn to regulate our thoughts, manage our emotions, and behave productively despite our circumstances - the 3 basic factors of mental strength. No matter what your goals are, building mental strength is the key to reaching your greatest potential.\n\nAmy Morin is a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist. Since 2002, she has been counseling children, teens, and adults. She also works as an adjunct psychology instructor.\r\n \r\nAmy’s expertise in mental strength has attracted international attention. Her bestselling book, 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do, is being translated into more than 20 languages.\r\n \r\nAmy’s advice has been featured by a number of media outlets, including: Time, Fast Company, Good Housekeeping, Business Insider, Elle, Cosmopolitan, Success, Glamour, Oprah.com, TheBlaze TV, and Fox News. She has also been a guest on dozens of radio shows.\r\n \r\nShe is a regular contributor to Forbes, Inc., and Psychology Today. She serves as About.com’s Parenting Teens Expert and Discipline Expert.\r\n \r\nAs a frequent keynote speaker, Amy loves to share the latest research on resilience and the best strategies for overcoming adversity and building mental muscle.\r\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                "description": "In a classic research-based TEDx Talk, Dr. Lara Boyd describes how neuroplasticity gives you the power to shape the brain you want. Recorded at TEDxVancouver at Rogers Arena on November 14, 2015.\n\nYouTube Tags: brain science, brain, stroke, neuroplasticity, science, motor learning, identity, TED, TEDxVancouver, TEDxVancouver 2015, Vancouver, TEDx, Rogers Arena, Vancouver speakers, Vancouver conference, ideas worth spreading, great idea,\n\nOur knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. \n\nDr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
